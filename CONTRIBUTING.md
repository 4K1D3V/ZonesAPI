## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- **Package**: All code resides under `pro.akii.ks`. Sub-packages include:
  - `core`: Core functionality (e.g., `ZonesAPICore`).
  - `nms`: NMS abstractions and adapters (e.g., `NmsAdapter`, `V1_21_R1`).
  - `zones`: Zone-related logic (e.g., `Zone`, `ZoneManager`).
  - `zones.effects`: Effect implementations (e.g., `PotionZoneEffect`, `NmsZoneEffect`).
- **File Naming**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `ZoneManager.java`).

### Coding Standards
- **JavaDoc**: Provide JavaDoc comments for all public classes, methods, and interfaces. Example:
  ```java
  /**
   * Applies an effect to a player.
   * @param player The player to affect.
   */
  public void apply(Player player);
